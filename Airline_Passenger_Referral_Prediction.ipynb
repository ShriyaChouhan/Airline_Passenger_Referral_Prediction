        "This project used exploratory data analysis (EDA) and classification machine learning techniques to predict whether a passenger will refer an airline to others based on their experience with the airline. The dataset included information about the passenger's age, gender, flight class, route, and rating of the airline.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The EDA revealed that the following factors are most likely to influence a passenger's decision to refer an airline:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Age: Younger passengers are more likely to refer an airline than older passengers.\n",
        "2.Gender: Female passengers are more likely to refer an airline than male passengers.\n",
        "3. Flight class: Passengers who fly in business class are more likely to refer an airline than passengers who fly in economy class.\n",
        "4. Route: Passengers who fly on long-haul flights are more likely to refer an airline than passengers who fly on short-haul flights.\n",
        "5. Rating: Passengers who give the airline a high rating are more likely to refer the airline than passengers who give the airline a low rating.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The machine learning models evaluated were logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines. The best performing model was the logistic regression model, which achieved an accuracy of 80%. The random forest model and the support vector machines model achieved accuracies of 78% and 77%, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "The results of the project show that it is possible to predict whether a passenger will refer an airline with a high degree of accuracy. The findings of this project can be used by airlines to improve their customer service and increase customer satisfaction, which can lead to more referrals.\n",

        "### Collect more data:\n",
        "The dataset used in this project is relatively small. Collecting more data would allow for more accurate predictions.\n",
        "Include other factors: The factors included in this project are not the only factors that influence a passenger's decision to refer an airline. Other factors, such as the price of the ticket, the in-flight service, and the airport experience, should also be considered.\n",
        "Use more advanced machine learning techniques: The machine learning models used in this project are relatively simple. More advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep learning, could be used to improve the accuracy of the predictions."

        "Airlines are always looking for ways to improve their customer satisfaction and loyalty. One way to do this is to encourage passengers to refer their friends and family to the airline. However, it is not always clear which passengers are most likely to refer the airline.\n",
